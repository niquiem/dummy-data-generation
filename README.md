# Makeup Database Generator for Accommodation Platforms

This project is a Python-based tool to simulate a database for an accommodation rental platform (like Airbnb). Perfect for testing database designs, workflows, or analysis without relying on live data.

If youâ€™re working on a project that requires database design but lacks suitable test data, this tool is for you. It includes:
	â€¢	Generated CSV files for tables like users, accommodations, bookings, payments, and more.
	â€¢	Python scripts to customize and generate data for various entities, ensuring logical relationships and constraints are respected.

## Features
1. **Comprehensive tables**
   - **User Table**: Includes user types (guest, host, admin), demographics, and activity data. Ensures at least 20 entries, with proportional roles.
   - **Accommodation Table**: Contains property details like price, location, and amenities, with at least 20 entries.
   - **Booking & Payment Tables**: Tracks user bookings, payments, and statuses, with all bookings referencing valid users and accommodations.
   - **Additional Tables**: Generates reviews, cancellations, notifications, admin actions, and more, while adhering to logical constraints such as minimum entries and valid relationships.

2. Constraints and Logical Rules
   â€¢	Ensures valid relationships between users, accommodations, bookings, and more.
   â€¢	Guarantees minimum entries for each table (e.g., 20 users, 20 properties).

2. Relationships:
	â€¢	All foreign keys reference valid primary keys in related tables.
	â€¢	Accommodations must have valid hosts from the Users table.
	â€¢	Bookings reference both valid guests and accommodations.
	â€¢	Reviews and payments are tied to confirmed bookings.

3.	Dynamic Logic:
	â€¢	Automatically scales related entries (e.g., cities per country, reviews per booking).
	â€¢	Validates data integrity (e.g., sufficient hosts for accommodations).

4. Customizable Scripts
   â€¢	Easily tweak data parameters to suit different scenarios or platform requirements.

## How to Use

### If you just want CSV files:
1. Clone the repository and run the script:
   ```bash
   python generate_data.py

2.	Find the generated files in the output_data/folder.

3.	Open them in any spreadsheet or database tool for analysis.

### If you want to customize the data:
1. Open the script in your IDE.
2. Adjust the parameters in the main() function (e.g., number of users, accommodations).
3. Run the script to generate customized datasets.


 ## Logical rules at a glance
* Minimum Entries: Each table starts with 20 rows.
* Relationships: All foreign keys reference valid primary keys.
* Data Validation: Ensures bookings have valid users and accommodations.
* Time-Specific Data: All generated records (e.g., bookings, payments, reviews) fall within the month of June 2024.


### Behind the scenes
Data is generated using the Faker library.
Parameters and distributions for realism are inspired by real-world use cases.
